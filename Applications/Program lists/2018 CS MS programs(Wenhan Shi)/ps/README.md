## MCDS @ CMU

__The application requires a statement of purpose. What makes a good essay?__  
We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.

## CS @ UTAustin

Remember that readers of your statement are CS researchers, but not necessarily in your area!
